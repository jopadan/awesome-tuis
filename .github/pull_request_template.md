Thank you for wanting to contribute to this list! There are many amazing terminal applications and our goal is to provide a place for people to discover them.

There are a few requirements for adding new applications to the list.

- Applications should be unique

    Please don't submit variations of existing applications
- Interfaces should be unique

    Please don't submit output formatters or wrappers (e.g. `fzf`)
- Interfaces should be interactive or re-draw output

    Scripts that accept text prompts are not a good fit for this list
